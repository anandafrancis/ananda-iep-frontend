<h2>Short-Term Objectives</h2>

<p>By the first reporting period, during structured activities when given advance reminders of intelligibility strategies
  (e.g., over-articulation, appropriate pace, orienting to listener) as needed, will produce speech that is 75% intelligible
  by employing intelligibility strategies, given recasted models of his utterance as needed and one verbal reminder to repeat
  or use a strategy.</p>

<p>By the second reporting period, during structured activities when given advance reminders of intelligibility strategies
  (e.g., over-articulation, appropriate pace, orienting to listener) as needed, will produce speech that is 80% intelligible
  by employing intelligibility strategies, given 1 recasted model of his utterance and one verbal reminder to repeat or use a strategy.</p>

<h2>SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED SELPA ANNUAL GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</h2>

<p><strong>Student Name:</strong> Birthdate: IEP Date: 4/22/2021</p>
<p><strong>Area of Need:</strong> Intelligibility</p>

<p><strong>Baseline:</strong> Currently, presents with several age-appropriate phonological processes, and one atypical process
  of palatalization. His mother rated his speech as 60-70% intelligible, and the speech-language pathologist rated his
  speech as 60% intelligible in known contexts to unfamiliar listeners.</p>

<p><strong>Measurable Annual Goal #:</strong> 3 by 4/21/2022</p>

<p>By 4/21/2022, during structured activities, will produce speech that is 90% intelligible by employing intelligibility
  strategies (e.g., over-articulation, appropriate pace, orienting to listener) as needed, given one verbal reminder to repeat
  or use a strategy across 3 consecutive sessions. As measured by: observation and data.</p>
