<body>

<h2>Short-Term Objective:</h2>
<p>By the first reporting period, during structured activities when given advance reminders of intelligibility strategies (e.g., over-articulation, appropriate pace, orienting to listener) as needed, the student will produce speech that is 75% intelligible by employing intelligibility strategies, given recasted models of his utterance as needed and one verbal reminder to repeat or use a strategy.</p>

<h2>Short-Term Objective:</h2>
<p>By the second reporting period, during structured activities when given advance reminders of intelligibility strategies (e.g., over-articulation, appropriate pace, orienting to listener) as needed, the student will produce speech that is 80% intelligible by employing intelligibility strategies, given 1 recasted model of his utterance and one verbal reminder to repeat or use a strategy.</p>

<p><strong>Student Name:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Birthdate:</strong></p>
<p><strong>IEP Date:</strong> 4/22/2021</p>
<p><strong>Area of Need:</strong> Intelligibility</p>
<p><strong>Baseline:</strong> Currently, the student presents with several age-appropriate phonological processes, and one atypical process of palatalization. 's mother rated his speech as 60-70% intelligible, and the speech-language pathologist rated his speech as 60% intelligible in known contexts to unfamiliar listeners.</p>
<p><strong>Measurable Annual Goal #:</strong> 3   by   4/21/2022</p>
<p>By 4/21/2022, during structured activities, the student will produce speech that is 90% intelligible by employing intelligibility strategies (e.g., over-articulation, appropriate pace, orienting to listener) as needed, given one verbal reminder to repeat or use a strategy across 3 consecutive sessions.</p>
